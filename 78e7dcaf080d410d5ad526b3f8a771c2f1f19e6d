I'd prefer to move them to the `translations/` dir at the project root dir. Translations are not config, so they shouldn't go to etc/ (or config/).

Can't the locale be an ENV variable?

I'm not sure that it would be useful, as most of the time it's application-specific, not platform-specific. That's why we often put it in parameters (and in `config.yml`) instead of env vars
