I'm afraid 7.1 was discarded for some Linux reasons (Ubuntu?) so we must stick to 7.0 for now.

I don't think I ever wrote that we would require 7.0. 7.1 might be a good idea.

7.1 would be great ... but reading your second tweet here: https://twitter.com/fabpot/status/844945740468183040  I thought you were saying that we'll use 7.0 because of Ubuntu.

`symfony/symfony` should probably be in sync with the PHP version shipped with Ubuntu. But `symfony/flex` can encourage the user to start with the latest version (and greatest features) of PHP.

And, in term of marketing, generating a skeleton using typehints and so on will increase the hype...

PHP 7.1 support introduced in another commit (if this is accepted I'll open another one to `symfony/skeleton`.
