It is a Flex feature or a Symfony feature?

it is a Flex feature. It will replace it by a random value when editing the .env file

@Pierstoval in #34 Fabien removed most references to the "Flex" name, so I thought it was a good idea to not mention it. But I've reworded to not mention neither Symfony nor Flex.

Yeah, because there's a difference between Symfony (the framework) and Symfony Flex (the package auto-configurator), and the server behind all of this that does the validation ðŸ˜† Lots of new cool stuff!
